# Summary Information
This program is a C# console application to perform numerous functionalities with student grades. This program was my first sorting application, and I used bubble sort to sort names and grades. The algorithm efficiency is O(n^2) meaning that it is not an efficient algorithm. However, this introductory project was a valuable learning experience allowing me to learn other algorithms too.
